## üçú Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner
<p align="center">
  <img width=40% height=40%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/127727503-9d9e7a25-93cb-4f95-8bd0-20b87cb4b459.png">

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny‚Äôs Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## üçï Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner
<p align="center">
  <img width=40% height=40%" src="/IMG/2.png">

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone would not help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## ü•ë Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi
<p align="center">
  <img width=40% height=40%" src="/IMG/3.png">

Subscription-based businesses are super popular and Danny realized that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data-driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## ü™ô Case Study #4 - Data Bank
<p align="center">
  <img width=40% height=40%" src=" /IMG/4.png ">

There is a new innovation in the financial industry called Neo-Banks: new aged digital-only banks without physical branches.

Danny thought that there should be some sort of intersection between these new-age banks, cryptocurrency and the data world‚Ä¶so he decides to launch a new initiative - Data Bank!

...

The management team at Data Bank wants to increase its total customer base - but also needs some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.

This case study is all about calculating metrics, and growth and helping the business analyze their data in a smart way to better forecast and plan for their future developments!

## üß∫ Case Study #5 - Data Mart

<p align="center">
<img width=40% height=40%" src=" /IMG/5.png ">

This case study actually is based on a real-life change in Australian retailers where plastic bags were no longer provided for free - as you can expect, some customers would have changed their shopping behaviour because of this change!

--

Analysis which is related to certain key events which can have a significant impact on sales or engagement metrics is always a part of the data analytics menu. Learning how to approach these types of problems is a super valuable lesson and hopefully, these ideas can help you next time you‚Äôre faced with a tough problem like this in the workplace!

## üõçÔ∏è Case Study #6 - Clique Bait


<p align="center">
<img width=40% height=40%" src=" /IMG/6.png ">

This case study is based off my many years working with Digital datasets in consumer banking and retail supermarkets - all of the datasets are designed based off real datasets I‚Äôve come across in challenging problem solving scenarios and the questions reflect similar problems which I worked on.

--


Campaign analysis is almost everywhere in the data world, especially in marketing, digital, UX and retail industries - and being able to analyse views, clicks and other digital behaviour is a critical skill to have in your toolbelt as a data professional!

## üëî Case Study #7 - Balanced Tree Clothing Co.

<p align="center">
<img width=40% height=40%" src=" /IMG/7.png ">

Sales, transactions and product exposure is always going to be a main objective for many data analysts and data scientists when working within a company that sells some type of product - Spoiler alert: nearly all companies will sell products!

--

Being able to navigate your way around a product hierarchy and understand the different levels of the structures as well as being able to join these details to sales related datasets will be super valuable for anyone wanting to work within a financial, customer or exploratory analytics capacity.

--

Hopefully these questions helped provide some exposure to the type of analysis we perform daily in these sorts of roles!

## üçä Case Study #8 - Fresh Segments

<p align="center">
<img width=40% height=40%" src=" /IMG/8.png ">

You have probably come across this concept of customer segments or marketing segments in your everyday life, maybe without you even noticing it!

--

Segments or audiences are super popular in the digital marketing space and using these interests or traits of customers is a mainstay of massive businesses like Google, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and other social media where there are targeted advertising.

--

Traditional businesses such as this client for Fresh Segments usually upload their customer emails or matched cookies into various digital marketing systems in order to generate some sort of match, usually using some machine learning methods, to other similar customers with the same interests.

--

Hopefully this case study helps you think about how these index metrics and compositions can be used for digital marketing!
